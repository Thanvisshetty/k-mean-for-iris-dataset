# K-Means Clustering on the Iris Dataset 
This project demonstrates the use of the K-means clustering algorithm on the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica) with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Code Explanation
Load the Iris Dataset: The dataset is loaded from scikit-learn.

Normalize the Data: Data is normalized to improve the performance of the K-means algorithm.

Apply K-means Clustering: The K-means algorithm is applied to cluster the data into three clusters.

Visualize the Results: The clusters are visualized to understand the performance of the algorithm
## Results
The K-means algorithm successfully clusters the Iris dataset into three clusters, corresponding to the three species of Iris flowers. The visualization shows the clustering results with cluster centers marked in red.
